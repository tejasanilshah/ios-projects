# iOS Projects

This repo contains most of the iOS side projects that I'm building.

Contains two versions of the same app, one built using Storyboards and Interface Builder (IB), the other using good old code.

Some of the projects are built along with a udemy course, the others are apps that I built for fun.

## [Animated Grid](./Animated%20Grid)

An animated grid built using code only.

## [I Am Rich](./I%20Am%20Rich) & [I Am Rich Code](./I%20Am%20Rich%20Code)
IB and code versions of an app that does nothing.

This is a rip off of the infamous [I Am Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich) app on the App store.
